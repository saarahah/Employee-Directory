# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory

## Deployed At

https://saarahah.github.io/Employee-Directory/

## Overview

For this assignment, I created a employee directory with React. This assignment required me to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

  * This uses the Random User API ( https://randomuser.me ) to generate a list of random employees.
  
  * The employee table includes:
      - Image
      - First Name
      - Last Name
      - Email
      - Age

The user can:

  * Sort the table by 3 categories

  * Search for an employee by first name.
